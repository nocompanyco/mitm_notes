- [ ] implement recommendations from https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security
  - [ ] turn off `enableRemoteModule: true`  (
        required for the loading of dialog but there may be alternative and could be a quick issue to fix)
  - [ ] turn off `nodeIntegration: true`  
        (this may be more complex to resolve. check.)
- [ ] integrate sudo UI (see Permissions_*.md)
