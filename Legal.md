License issues to followup on

- Winpcap/NPcap
  license may restrict our ability to install this library and require user to first install it (via wireshark)
  could switch to https://reqrypt.org/windivert.html windivert which is LGPL (see pydivert)
- Packery requires we distribute in GPL compatible license. Does MIT count?
  https://packery.metafizzy.co/#license

Need to check the many many other licenses used. All are open source but not sure under what specifics and if we are permitted to packet in our MIT Licensed project or not.
